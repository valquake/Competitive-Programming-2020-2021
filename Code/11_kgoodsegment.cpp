	Solution Description:
	Solution consists on considering left and right position i and j (initially set to zero). With an hashmap, I keep track of frequencies of elements actually 
	between left index i and right index j.
	Everytime I move j by one position and I check if I already met current right element or not:
	- If it is, I don't need to check any other thing, except if my actual segment is longer than max segment length. In case, I have to update i and j.   
	- Otherwise, I check if I have less than k distinct elements or not.
		- If I have it, I simply update hashmap with my new element and in case longest path segment' indexes.
		- If not, I move on left index i, updating frequencies, until it is erased from hashmap frequency a sufficient number of elements that bring me back to 
		  have no more than k elements.
	When I reach the end of array with right index, I print left and right indexes that maximize length of k-good segment.

	Complexity: 
	As there will be no more than n deletions and insertions, time complexity is Î˜(n). Space complexity is O(n).
