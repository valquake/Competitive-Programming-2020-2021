/**
 * Author : Valeria Montagna
 * 
 * Description :
 * For this solution, I store vector's elements in a max heap, to give them a decreasing order.
 * In turn, I pop every element and I keep track of the number of unique elements and the most frequent
 * element in the heap. At the end, I print the results.
 *  
 * Time complexity :
 * for every item in the vector, there's a push and a pop. Their cost is logaritmic. In total Î˜(nlog(n))
